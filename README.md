# Colin Robinson's React Portfolio

This project features a new, up-to-date portfolio using Vite and React.

This portfolio shares my past (and still present) life as a professional drummer, and showcases work I've now done as a new full-stack developer.

React has been a joy to learn, and I look forward to getting better at it in the future.

# Technologies used:

This website, as stated, uses React with Vite, and some of the functionality that those offer, including "useState" and "react-router-dom" to replace certain components with others for a slick dom manipulation.
